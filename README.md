* Try out the GitHub Actions plugin in Codespaces
* Keep adding versions of Python until you find a version that doesn't work

* Put one of your mini-projects into this repo and find out what versions of Python are supported
* Create Build badges for each version of Python




1. First thing to do on launch is to open a new shell and verify virtualenv is sourced.

Things included are:

* `Makefile`

* `Pytest`

* `pandas`
