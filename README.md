## Template for Python projects with RUFF linter

![1 15_rust_built_python_tools](https://github.com/nogibjj/python-ruff-template/assets/58792/db5f7bda-a977-4c67-acbe-a70fe034fbdf)

### Lab:

* Use an AI Assistant, but use a different one then you used from a previous lab (Anthropic's Claud, Bard, Copilot, CodeWhisperer, Colab AI, etc)
* ETL-Query:  [E] Extract a dataset from URL, [T] Transform, [L] Load into SQLite Database and [Q] Query
For the ETL-Query lab:
* [E] Extract a dataset from a URL like Kaggle or data.gov. JSON or CSV formats tend to work well.
* [T] Transform the data by cleaning, filtering, enriching, etc to get it ready for analysis.
* [L] Load the transformed data into a SQLite database table using Python's sqlite3 module.
* [Q] Write and execute SQL queries on the SQLite database to analyze and retrieve insights from the data.

#### Tasks:

* Fork this project and get it to run
* Make the query more useful and not a giant mess that prints to screen
* Convert the main.py into a command-line tool that lets you run each step independantly
* Fork this project and do the same thing for a new dataset you choose
* Make sure your project passes tests and has a built badge




#### Ideas
